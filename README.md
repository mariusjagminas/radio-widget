# Radio widget

Demo of UI component with simple functionality, built with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Local development

1. Clone the repository to your local machine

   ```
   $ git clone https://github.com/mariusjagminas/radio-widget.git
   ```

2. Navigate to `radio-widget` directory.

   ```
   $ cd radio-widget
   ```

3. Install all dependencies

   ```
   $ npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server

   ```
   npm start
   ```

The server will open the browser at `localhost: 3000`, and you will see the widget live.
